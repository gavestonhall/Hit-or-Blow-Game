# Hit-or-Blow-Game
Another small project I did for fun.

HIT or BLOW game!
You have 10 guesses to enter the correct 4 digit number.
At the end of each guess you will receive HITS or BLOWS.
HIT: Correct digit and in the correct position.
BLOW: Correct digit but not in the correct position.
You need to guess the correct 4 digit number within 10
tries or it is game over.
NOTE: Each digit in the code is unique, there will never be
more than one of the same digit. i.e '2255' '4555'

If you do not have Python 3 installed:
You can visit https://trinket.io/ and paste the code to run the game online.
