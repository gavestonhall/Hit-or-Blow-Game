HIT or BLOW game!

You have 10 guesses to enter the correct 4 digit number.
At the end of each guess you will receive HITS or BLOWS.
HIT: Correct digit and in the correct position.
BLOW: Correct digit but not in the correct position.

You need to guess the correct 4 digit number within 10
tries or it is game over.

NOTE: Each digit in the code is unique, there will never be
more than one of the same digit. i.e '2255' '4555'
